                    What Newspapers Have Said About Elsie Benedict and Her Work        "Over fifty thousand people heard Elsie Lincoln Benedict at the City Auditorium during her six weeks lecture engagement in Milwaukee."-Milwaukee Leader, April 2, 1921.      "Elsie Lincoln Benedict has a brilliant record. She is like a fresh breath of Colorado ozone. Her ideas are as stimulating as the health-giving breezes of the Rockies."-New York Evening Mail, April 16, 1914.      "Several hundred people were turned away from the Masonic Temple last night where Elsie Lincoln Benedict, famous human analyst, spoke on ’How to Analyze People on Sight.’ Asked how she could draw and hold a crowd of 3,000 for a lecture, she said: ’Because I talk on the one subject on earth in which every individual is most interested-himself.’"-Seattle Times, June 2, 1920.      "Elsie Lincoln Benedict is a woman who has studied deeply under genuine scientists and is demonstrating to thousands at the Auditorium each evening that she knows the connection between an individual’s external characteristics and his inner traits."-Minneapolis News, November 7, 1920.      "Elsie Lincoln Benedict is known nationally, having conducted lecture courses in many of the large Eastern cities. Her work is based upon the practical methods of modern science as worked out in the world’s leading laboratories where exhaustive tests are applied to determine individual types, talents, vocational bents and possibilities."-San Francisco Bulletin, January 25, 1919.                </div>

What Leading Newspapers Say About Elsie Lincoln
Benedict and Her Work


"Over fifty thousand people heard Elsie Lincoln Benedict at the City Auditorium
during her six weeks lecture engagement in Milwaukee."—Milwaukee Leader, April
2, 1921.
"Elsie Lincoln Benedict has a brilliant record. She is like a fresh breath of Colorado
ozone. Her ideas are as stimulating as the health-giving breezes of the Rockies."—
New York Evening Mail, April 16, 1914.
"Several hundred people were turned away from the Masonic Temple last night where
Elsie Lincoln Benedict, famous human analyst, spoke on 'How to Analyze People on
Sight.' Asked how she could draw and hold a crowd of 3,00; 0 for a lecture, she said:
'Because I talk on the one subject on earth in which every individual is most
interested—himself.'"—Seattle Times, June 2, 1920.
"Elsie Lincoln Benedict is a woman who has studied deeply under genuine scientists
and is demonstrating to thousands at the Auditorium each evening that she knows the
connection between an individual's external characteristics and his inner traits."—
Minneapolis News, November 7, 1920.
"Elsie Lincoln Benedict is known nationally, having conducted lecture courses in
many of the large Eastern cities. Her work is based upon the practical methods of
modern science as worked out in the world's leading laboratories where exhaustive
tests are applied to determine individual types, talents, vocational bents and
possibilities."—San Francisco Bulletin, January 25, 1919.

It's not
how much you
know but what
you can
DO
that counts


[Pg 11]

Human Analysis—The X-Ray
Modern science has proved that the fundamental traits of every individual are
indelibly stamped in the shape of his body, head, face and hands—an X-ray by
which you can read the characteristics of any person on sight.

he most essential thing in the world to any individual is to understand himself. The
next is to understand the other fellow. For life is largely a problem of running your
own car as it was built to be run, plus getting along with the other drivers on the
highway.
From this book you are going to learn which type of car you are and the main reasons
why you have not been getting the maximum of service out of yourself.
Also you are going to learn the makes of other human cars, and how to get the
maximum of co-operation out of them. This co-operation is vital to happiness and
success. We come in contact with our fellowman in all the activities of our lives and
what we get out of life depends, to an astounding degree, on our relations with him.
Reaction to Environment

¶ The greatest problem facing any organism is successful reaction to its environment.
Environment, speaking scientifically, is the sum total of your experiences. In plain
United States, this means fitting vocationally, socially and maritally into the place
where you are.[Pg 12]
If you don't fit you must move or change your environment to fit you. If you can't
change the environment and you won't move you will become a failure, just as tropical
plants fail when transplanted to the Nevada desert.


Learn From the Sagebrush

¶ But there is something that grows and keeps on growing in the Nevada desert—the
sagebrush. It couldn't move away and it couldn't change its waterless environment, so
it did what you and I must do if we expect to succeed. It adapted itself to its
environment, and there it stands, each little stalwart shrub a reminder of what even a
plant can do when it tries!
Moving Won't Help Much

¶ Human life faces the same alternatives that confront all other forms of life—of
adapting itself to the conditions under which it must live or becoming extinct. You
have an advantage over the sagebrush in that you can move from your city or state or
country to another, but after all that is not much of an advantage. For though you may
improve your situation slightly you will still find that in any civilized country the main
elements of your problem are the same.
Understand Yourself and Others

¶ So long as you live in a civilized or thickly populated community you will still need
to understand your own nature and the natures of other people. No matter what you
desire of life, other people's aims, ambitions and activities[Pg 13] constitute vital
obstructions along your pathway. You will never get far without the co-operation,
confidence and comradeship of other men and women.
Primitive Problems

¶ It was not always so. And its recentness in human history may account for some of
our blindness to this great fact.
In primitive times people saw each other rarely and had much less to do with each
other. The human element was then not the chief problem. Their environmental
problems had to do with such things as the elements, violent storms, extremes of heat
and cold, darkness, the ever-present menace of wild beasts whose flesh was their food,
yet who would eat them first unless they were quick in brain and body.
Civilization's Changes

¶ But all that is changed. Man has subjugated all other creatures and now walks the
earth its supreme sovereign. He has discovered and invented and builded until now we
live in skyscrapers, talk around the world without wires and by pressing a button turn
darkness into daylight.


Causes of Failure

¶ Yet with all our knowledge of the outside world ninety-nine lives out of every
hundred are comparative failures.
¶ The reason is plain to every scientific investigator. We have failed to study ourselves
in relation to the great environmental problem of today. The stage-setting has been[Pg
14] changed but not the play. The game is the same old game—you must adjust and
adapt yourself to your environment or it will destroy you.
Mastering His Own Environment

¶ The cities of today look different from the jungles of our ancestors and we imagine
that because the brain of man overcame the old menaces no new ones have arisen to
take their place. We no longer fear extermination from cold. We turn on the heat. We
are not afraid of the vast oceans which held our primitive forebears in thrall, but pass
swiftly, safely and luxuriously over their surfaces. And soon we shall be breakfasting
in New York and dining the same evening in San Francisco!
Facing New Enemies

¶ But in building up this stupendous superstructure of modern civilization man has
brought into being a society so intricate and complex that he now faces the new
environmental problem of human relationships.
The Modern Spider's Web

¶ Today we depend for life's necessities almost wholly upon the activities of others.
The work of thousands of human hands and thousands of human brains lies back of
every meal you eat, every journey you take, every book you read, every bed in which
you sleep, every telephone conversation, every telegram you receive, every garment
you wear.
And this fellowman of ours has multiplied, since that dim[Pg 15] distant dawn, into
almost two billion human beings, with at least one billion of them after the very things
you want, and not a tenth enough to go around!
Adapt or Die

¶ Who will win? Nature answers for you. She has said with awful and inexorable
finality that, whether you are a blade of grass on the Nevada desert or a man in the
streets of London, you can win only as you adapt yourself to your environment. Today
our environmental problem consists largely of the other fellow. Only those who learn
to adapt themselves to their fellows can win great or lasting rewards.


Externals Indicate Internal Nature

¶ To do this it is necessary to better understand our neighbors—to recognize that
people differ from each other in their likes and dislikes, traits, talents, tendencies and
capabilities. The combination of these makes each individual's nature. It is not
difficult to understand others for with each group of these traits there always goes its
corresponding physical makeup—the externals whereby the internal is invariably
indicated. This is true of every species on the globe and of every subdivision within
each species.
Significance of Size, Shape and Structure

¶ All dogs belong to the same species but there is a great difference between the
"nature" of a St. Bernard and that of a terrier, just as there is a decided difference
between the natures of different human beings. But in both instances the[Pg 16]
actions, reactions and habits of each can be accurately anticipated on sight by the
shape, size and structure of the two creatures.
Differences in Breed

¶ When a terrier comes into the room you instinctively draw away unless you want to
be jumped at and greeted effusively. But you make no such movement to protect
yourself from a St. Bernard because you read, on sight, the different natures of these
two from their external appearance.
¶ You know a rose, a violet, a sunflower and an orchid and what perfume you are sure
to find in each, by the same method. All are flowers and all belong to the same
species, just as all human beings belong to the same species. But their respective size,
shape and structure tell you in advance and on sight what their respective
characteristics are.
The same is true of all human beings. They differ in certain fundamentals but always
and invariably in accordance with their differences in size, shape and structure.
The Instinct of Self-Preservation

¶ The reason for this is plain. Goaded by the instinct of self-preservation, man, like all
other living things, has made heroic efforts to meet the demands of his environment.
He has been more successful than any other creature and is, as a result, the most
complex organism on the earth. But his most baffling complexities resolve themselves
into comparatively simple terms once it is recognized that each internal change
brought about by his environment brought with it[Pg 17] the corresponding external
mechanism without which he could not have survived.


Interrelation of Body and Brain

¶ So today we see man a highly evolved creature who not only acts but thinks and
feels. All these thoughts, feelings and emotions are interrelated.
The body and the mind of man are so closely bound together that whatever affects one
affects the other. An instantaneous change of mind instantly changes the muscles of
the face. A violent thought instantly brings violent bodily movements.
Movies and Face Muscles

¶ The moving picture industry—said to be the third largest in the world—is based
largely on this interrelation. This industry would become extinct if something were to
happen to sever the connection between external expressions and the internal nature of
men and women.
Tells Fundamentals

¶ How much do external characteristics tell about a man? They tell, with amazing
accuracy, all the basic, fundamental principal traits of his nature. The size, shape and
structure of a man's body tell more important facts about his real self—what he thinks
and what he does—than the average mother ever knows about her own child.
Learning to Read

¶ If this sounds impossible, if the seeming incongruity,[Pg 18] multiplicity and
heterogeneity of human qualities have baffled you, remember that this is exactly how
the print in all books and newspapers baffled you before you learned to read.
Not long ago I was reading stories aloud to a three-year old. She wanted to "see the
pictures," and when told there were none had to be shown the book.
"What funny little marks!" she cried, pointing to the print. "How do you get stories out
of them?"
Printing looked to all of us at first just masses of meaningless little marks.
But after a few days at school how things did begin to clear up! It wasn't a jumble
after all. There was something to it. It straightened itself out until the funny little
marks became significant. Each of them had a meaning and the same meaning under
all conditions. Through them your whole outlook on life became deepened and
broadened—all because you learned the meaning of twenty-six little letters and their
combinations!


Reading People

¶ Learning to read men and women is a more delightful process than learning to read
books, for every person you see is a true story, more romantic and absorbing than any
ever bound in covers.
Learning to read people is also a simpler process than learning to read books because
there are fewer letters in the human alphabet. Though man seems to the untrained eye
a mystifying mass of "funny little marks," he is not now difficult to analyze.[Pg 19]
Only a Few Feelings

¶ This is because there are after all but a few kinds of human feelings. Some form of
hunger, love, hate, fear, hope or ambition gives rise to every human emotion and
every human thought.
Thoughts Bring Actions

¶ Now our actions follow our thoughts. Every thought, however transitory, causes
muscular action, which leaves its trace in that part of the physical organism which is
most closely allied to it.
Physiology and Psychology Interwoven

¶ Look into the mirror the next time you are angry, happy, surprised, tired or
sorrowful and note the changes wrought by your emotions in your facial muscles.
Constant repetition of the same kinds of thoughts or emotions finally makes
permanent changes in that part of the body which is physiologically related to these
mental processes.
The Evolution of the Jaw

¶ The jaw is a good illustration of this alliance between the mind and the body. Its
muscles and bones are so closely allied to the pugnacity instinct center in the brain
that the slightest thought of combat causes the jaw muscles to stiffen. Let the thought
of any actual physical encounter go through your mind and your jaw bone will
automatically move upward and outward.[Pg 20]
After a lifetime of combat, whether by fists or words, the jaw sets permanently a little
more upward and outward—a little more like that of the bulldog. It keeps to this
combative mold, "because," says Mother Nature, the great efficiency expert, "if you
are going to call on me constantly to stiffen that jaw I'll fix it so it will stay that way
and save myself the trouble."


Inheritance of Acquired Traits

¶ Thus the more combative jaw, having become permanent in the man's organism, can
be passed on to his children.
¶ Right here comes a most interesting law and one that has made possible the science
of Human Analysis:
Law of Size

¶ The larger any part or organ the better its equipment for carrying out the work of
that organ and the more does it tend to express itself. Nature IS an efficiency expert
and doesn't give you an oversupply of anything without demanding that you use it.
Jaws Becoming Smaller

¶ Our ancestors developed massive jaws as a result of constant combat. As fast as
civilization decreased the necessity for combat Nature decreased the size of the
average human jaw.
Meaning of the Big Jaw

¶ But wherever you see a large protruding jaw you see an individual "armed and
engined," as Kipling says, for some[Pg 21] kind of fighting. The large jaw always
goes with a combative nature, whether it is found on a man or a woman, a child, a
pugilist or a minister.
Exhibit A—The Irishman

¶ The large jaw, therefore, is seen to be both a result and a cause of certain things. As
the inheritance of a fighting ancestor it is the result of millions of years of fighting in
prehistoric times, and, like any other over-developed part or organ, it has an intense
urge to express itself. This inherent urge is what makes the owner of that jaw "fight at
the drop of the hat," and often have "a chip on his shoulder."
Natural Selection

¶ Thus, because every external characteristic is the result of natural laws, and chiefly
of natural selection, the vital traits of any creature can be read from his externals.
Every student of biology, anatomy, anthropology, ethnology or psychology is familiar
with these facts.
Built to Fit

¶ Man's organism has developed, altered, improved and evolved "down through the
slow revolving years" with one instinctive aim—successful reaction to its


environment. Every part has been laboriously constructed to that sole end. Because of
this its functions are marked as clearly upon it as those of a grain elevator, a steamship
or a piano.
Survival of the Fittest

¶ Nature has no accidents, she wastes no material and[Pg 22] everything has a
purpose. If you put up a good fight to live she will usually come to your rescue and
give you enough of whatever is needed to tide you over. If you don't, she says you are
not fit to people the earth and lets you go without a pang. Thus she weeds out all but
the strong—and evolution marches on.
Causes of Racial Characteristics

¶ This inherent potentiality for altering the organism to meet the demands of the
environment is especially noticeable in races and is the reason for most racial
differences.
Differences in environment—climate, altitude and topography necessitated most of
these physical differentiations which today enable us to know at a glance whether a
man belongs to the white race, the yellow race, or the black race. The results of these
differentiations and modifications will be told in the various chapters of this book.
Types Earlier than Races

¶ The student of Human Analysis reads the disposition and nature of every individual
with ease regardless of whether that individual be an American, a Frenchman, a Kaffir
or a Chinaman, because Human Analysis explains those fundamental traits which run
through every race, color and nationality, according to the externals which always go
with those traits.
Five Biological Types

¶ Human Analysis differs from every other system of[Pg 23] character analysis in that
it classifies man, for the first time, into five types according to his biological evolution.
¶ It deals with man in the light of the most recent scientific discoveries. It estimates
each individual according to his "human" qualities rather than his "character" or socalled "moral" qualities. In other words, it takes his measure as a human being and
determines from his externals his chances for success in the world of today.
These Rules Work

¶ Every rule in this book is based on scientific data, has been proved to be accurate by
investigations and surveys of all kinds of people in all parts of the world.


These rules do not work merely part of the time. They work all the time, under all
conditions and apply to every individual of every race, every color, every country,
every community and every family.
Through this latest human science you can learn to read people as easily as you read
books—if you will take the little time and pains to learn the rules which compose your
working alphabet.
Do What We Want to Do

¶ It is easy to know what an individual will do under most circumstances because
every human being does what he wants to do in the way he prefers to do it most of the
time. If you doubt it try this test: bring to mind any intimate friends, or even that
husband or wife, and note how few changes they have made in their way of doing
things in twenty years!
[Pg 24]
Preferences Inborn

¶ Every human being is born with preferences and predilections which manifest
themselves from earliest childhood to death. These inborn tendencies are never
obliterated and seldom controlled to any great extent, and then only by individuals
who have learned the power of the mind over the body. Inasmuch as this knowledge is
possessed by only a few, most of the people of the earth are blindly following the
dictates of their inborn leanings.
Follow Our Bents

¶ In other words, more than ninety-nine per cent of all the people you know are
following their natural bents in reacting to all their experiences—from the most trivial
incidents to the most far-reaching emergencies.
"Took It" From Grandmother

¶ The individual is seldom conscious of these habitual acts of his, much less of where
he got them. The nearest he comes is to say he "got it from his father" or "she takes it
from grandmother." But where did grandmother get it?
Man No Mystery

¶ Science has taken the trouble to investigate and today we know not only where
grandmother got it but what she did with it. She got it along with her size, shape and
structure—in other words, from her type—and she did just what you and everybody
else does with his type-characteristics. She acted in accordance with her type just as a


canary[Pg 25] sings like a canary instead of talking like a parrot, and just as a rose
gives off rose perfume instead of violet.
This law holds throughout every species and explains man—who likes to think
himself a deep mystery—as it explains every other creature.
The Hold of Habit

¶ Look around you in shop, office, field or home and you will find that the quick,
alert, impulsive man is acting quickly, alertly and impulsively most of the time.
Nothing less than a calamity slows him down and then only temporarily; while the
slow, patient, mild and passive individual is acting slowly, patiently, mildly and
passively in spite of all goads. Some overwhelming passion or crisis may speed him
up momentarily but as soon as it fades he reverts to his old slow habits.
Significance of Fat, Bone and Muscle

¶ Human Analysis is the new science which shows you how to recognize the slow
man, the quick man, the stubborn man, the yielding man, the leader, the learner, and
all other basic kinds of men on sight from the shape, size and structure of their bodies.
Certain bodily shapes indicate predispositions to fatness, leanness, boniness,
muscularity and nervousness, and this predisposition is so much a part of the warp and
woof of the individual that he can not disguise it. The urge given him by this inborn
mechanism is so strong as to be practically irresistible. Every experience of his life
calls forth[Pg 26] some kind of reaction and invariably the reaction will be similar, in
every vital respect, to the reactions of other people who have bodies of the same
general size, shape and structure as his own.
Succeed at What We Like

¶ No person achieves success or happiness when compelled to do what he naturally
dislikes to do. Since these likes and dislikes stay with him to the grave, one of the
biggest modern problems is that of helping men and women to discover and to
capitalize their inborn traits.
Enthusiasm and Self-Expression

¶ Every individual does best those things which permit him to act in accordance with
his natural bents. This explains why we like best those things we do best. It takes real
enthusiasm to make a success of any undertaking for nothing less than enthusiasm can
turn on a full current.
We struggle from the cradle to the grave for self-expression and everything that
pushes us in a direction opposed to our natural tendencies is done half-heartedly,
inefficiently and disgruntledly. These are the steps that lead straight to failure. Yet


failure can be avoided and success approximated by every normal person if he will
take the same precaution with his own machinery that he takes with his automobile.
Learn to Drive Your Car

¶ If you were presented with a car by your ancestors[Pg 27]—which is precisely what
happened to you at birth—you would not let an hour go by without finding out what
make or type of car it was. Before a week elapsed you would have taken the time,
labor and interest to learn how to run it,—not merely any old way, but the best way for
that particular make of car.
Five Makes of Human Cars

¶ There are five makes or types of human cars, differing as definitely in size, shape
and structure as Fords differ from Pierce-Arrows. Each human type differs as widely
in its capacities, possibilities and aptitudes as a Ford differs from a Pierce-Arrow. Like
the Ford or Pierce the externals indicate these functional differences with unfailing
accuracy. Furthermore just as a Ford never changes into a Pierce nor a Pierce into a
Ford, a human being never changes his type. He may modify it, train it, polish it or
control it somewhat, but he will never change it.
Can Not be Deceived

¶ The student of Human Analysis cannot be deceived as to the type of any individual
any more than you can be deceived about the make of a car.
One may "doll up" a Ford to his heart's content—remove the hood and top and put on
custom-made substitutes—it is still a Ford, always will be a Ford and you can always
detect that it is a Ford. It will do valuable, necessary things but only those things it
was designed to do and in its own particular manner; nor could a Pierce act like a
Ford.
[Pg 28]
Are You a Ford or a Pierce?

¶ So it is with human cars. Maybe you have been awed by the jewels and clothes with
which many human Fords disguise themselves. The chances are that you have
overlooked a dozen Pierces this week because their paint was rusty. Perchance you are
a Pierce yourself, drawing a Ford salary because you don't know you are a highpowered machine capable of making ten times the speed you have been making on
your highway of life.


Superficialities Sway Us

¶ If so your mistake is only natural. The world classifies human beings according to
their superficialities. To the world a human motorcycle can pass for a Rolls-Royce any
day if sufficiently camouflaged with diamonds, curls, French heels and plucked
eyebrows.
Bicycles in Congress

¶ In the same manner many a bicycle in human form gets elected to Congress because
he plays his machinery for all it is worth and gets a hundred per cent service out of it.
Every such person learned early in life what kind of car he was and capitalized its
natural tendencies.
Don't Judge by Veneer

¶ Nothing is more unsafe than to attempt to judge the actual natures of people by their
clothes, houses, religious faith, political affiliations, prejudices, dialect, etiquette or
customs. These are only the veneer laid on by upbringing,[Pg 29] teachers, preachers,
traditions and other forces of suggestion, and it is a veneer so thin that trifles scratch it
off.
The Real Always There

¶ But the real individual is always there, filled with the tendencies of his type, bending
always toward them, constantly seeking opportunities to run as he was built to run,
forever striving toward self-expression. It is this ever-active urge which causes him to
revert, in the manifold activities of everyday life, to the methods, manners and
peculiarities common to his type.
This means that unless he gets into an environment, a vocation and a marriage which
permits of his doing what he wants to do he will be miserable, inefficient,
unsuccessful and sometimes criminal.
Causes of Crime

¶ That this is the true explanation of crime has been recognized for many years by
leading thinkers. Two prison wardens—Thomas Tynan of Colorado and Thomas Mott
Osborne of Sing Sing—effectively initiated penal reforms based upon it.
Every crime, like every personal problem, arises from some kind of situation wherein
instinct is thwarted by outside influence.
¶ Human Analysis teaches you to recognize, on sight, the predominant instincts of any
individual—in brief, what that individual is inclined to do under all the general
situations of his life. You know what the world tries to compel him to do. If the


discrepancy between these two is beyond the reach of his type he refuses to do what
society[Pg 30] demands. This and this only is back of every human digression from
indiscretion to murder.
It is as vain to expect to eradicate these inborn trends and put others in their places as
to make a sewing machine out of an airplane or an oak out of a pine. The most man
can do for his neighbor is to understand and inspire him. The most he can do for
himself is to understand and organize his inborn capacities.
Find Your Own Type

¶ The first problem of your happiness is to find out what type you are yourself—which
you will know after reading this book—and to build your future accordingly.
Knowing and Helping Others

¶ The second is to learn how to analyze others to the end that your relationships with
them may be harmonious and mutually advantageous.
Take every individual according to the way he was born, accept him as that kind of
mechanism and deal with him in the manner befitting that mechanism. In this way and
this only will you be able to impress or to help others.
In this way only will you be able to achieve real success. In this way only will you be
able to help your fellowman find the work, the environment and the marriage wherein
he can be happy and successful.
The Four C's

¶ To get the maximum of pleasure and knowledge out of[Pg 31] this interesting course
there are four things to remember as your part of the contract.
Read CONCENTRATEDLY

¶ Think of what you are reading while you are reading it. Concentration is a very
simple thing. The next C is
Observe CAREFULLY

¶ Look at people carefully (but not starefully) when analyzing them. Don't jump at
conclusions. We humans have a great way of twisting facts to fit our conclusion as
soon as we have made one. But don't spend all your time getting ready to decide and
forget to decide at all, like the man who was going to jump a ditch. He ran so far back
to get a good start each time that he never had the strength to jump when he got there.
Get a good start by observing carefully. Then


Decide CONFIDENTLY

¶ Be sure you are right and then go ahead. Make a decision and make it with the
confidence that you are right. If you will determine now to follow this rule it will
compel you to follow the first two because, in order to be sure you are right, to be
certain you are not misjudging anybody, you will read each rule concentratedly and
observe each person carefully beforehand.
Practise CONSTANTLY

¶ "Practice makes perfect." Take this for your motto if you would become expert in
analyzing people. It is one[Pg 32] easily followed for you come in contact with people
everywhere—at home, amongst your business associates, with your friends and on the
street. Remember you can only benefit from a thing as you use it. A car that you never
took out of the garage would be of no value to you. So get full value out of this course
by using it at all times.
These Rules Your Tools

¶ These rules are scientific. They are true and they are true always. They are very
valuable tools for the furtherance of your progress through life.
An understanding of people is the greatest weapon you can possess. Therefore these
are the most precious tools you can own. But like every tool in the world and all
knowledge in the world, they must be used as they were built to be used or you will
get little service out of them.
You would not expect to run a car properly without paying the closest attention to the
rules for clutches, brakes, starters and gears. Everything scientific is based not on
guesses but laws. This course in Analyzing People on Sight is as scientific as the
automobile. It will carry you far and do it easily if you will do your part. Your part
consists of learning the few simple rules laid down in this book and in applying them
in the everyday affairs of your life.
Fewer and Truer

¶ Many things which have been found to be true in almost every instance could have
been included in this course. But we prefer to make fewer statements and have those
of[Pg 33] bedrock certainty. Therefore this course, like all our courses, consists
exclusively of those facts which have been found to be true in every particular of
people in normal health.
IMPORTANT


The Five Extremes

¶ This book deals with PURE or UNMIXED types only. When you understand these,
the significance of their several combinations as seen in everyday life will be clear to
you.
The Human Alphabet

¶ Just as you can not understand the meaning of a word until you know the letters that
go into the makeup of that word, you cannot analyze people accurately until you get
these five extreme types firmly in your mind, for they are your alphabet.
Founded in Five Biological Systems

¶ Each PURE type is the result of the over-development of one of the five biological
systems possessed by all human beings—the nutritive, circulatory, muscular, bony or
nervous.
Therefore every individual exhibits to some degree the characteristics of all the five
types.[Pg 34]
The Secret of Individuality

¶ But his PREDOMINANT traits and INDIVIDUALITY—the things that make him
the KIND of man he is—agree infallibly with whichever one of the five systems
PREDOMINATES in him.
Combinations Common in America

¶ The average American man or woman is a COMBINATION of some two of these
types with a third discernible in the background.
To Analyze People

¶ To understand human beings familiarize yourself first with the PURE or UNMIXED
types and then it will be easy and fascinating to spell out their combinations and what
they mean in the people all about you.
Postpone Combinations

¶ Until you have learned these pure types thoroughly it will be to your advantage to
forget that there is such a thing as combinations. After you have these extreme types
well in mind you will be ready to analyze combinations.


The Five Types

¶ Science has discovered that there are five types of human beings. Discarding for a
moment their technical names, they may be called the fat people, the florid people, the
muscular people, the bony people and the mental people.
Each varies from the others in shape, size and structure and[Pg 35] is recognizable at a
glance by his physique or build. This is because his type is determined by the
preponderance within his body of one of the five great departments or biological
systems—the nutritive, the circulatory, the muscular, the bony or the nervous.
At Birth

¶ Every child is born with one of these systems more highly developed, larger and
better equipped than the others.
Type Never Disappears

¶ Throughout his life this system will express itself more, be more intense and
constant in its functioning than the others and no manner of training, education,
environment or experience, so long as he remains in normal health, will alter the
predominance of this system nor prevent its dictating his likes, dislikes and most of his
reactions.
Effect of Eating

¶ If you do not understand why the overaction of one bodily system should influence a
man's nature see if you can't recall more than one occasion when a square meal made a
decided difference in your disposition within the space of thirty minutes.
If one good meal has the power to alter so completely our personalities temporarily, is
it then any wonder that constant overfeeding causes everybody to love a fat man? For
the fat man is habitually and chronically in that beatific state which comes from overeating.

[Pg 36]


[Pg 37]

CHAPTER I

The Alimentive Type
"The Enjoyer"

Note: Bear in mind at the beginning of this and every other chapter, that we are
describing the extreme or unmixed type. Before leaving this book you will
understand combination types and should read people as readily as you now
read your newspaper.


hose individuals in whom the alimentive system is more highly developed than any
other are called Alimentives. The alimentive system consists of the stomach,
intestines, alimentary canal and every part of the assimilative apparatus.
Physical Rotundity

¶ A general rotundity of outline characterizes this type. He is round in every direction.
Fat rolls away from his elbows, wrists, knees and shoulders. (See Chart 1)
[Pg 38]
The Fat, Overweight Individual

¶ Soft flesh thickly padded over a small-boned body distinguishes the pure Alimentive
type. In men of this type the largest part of the body is around the girth; in women it is
around the hips. These always indicate a large nutritive system in good working order.
Fat is only surplus tissue—the amount manufactured by the assimilative system over
and above the needs of the body.
Fat is more soft and spongy than bone or muscle and lends to its wearer a softer
structure and appearance.
Small Hands and Feet

¶ Because his bones are small the pure Alimentive has small feet and small hands.
How many times you have noted with surprise that the two hundred pound woman
had tiny feet! The inconvenience of "getting around" which you have noticed in her is
due to the fact that while she has more weight to carry she has smaller than average
feet with which to do it.
The Pure Alimentive Head

¶ A head comparatively small for the body is[Pg 39] another characteristic of the
extreme Alimentive. The neck and lower part of the head are covered with rolls of fat.
This gives the head the effect of spreading outward from the crown as it goes down to
the neck, thus giving the neck a short, disproportionately large appearance.


The Round-Faced Person

¶ A "full-moon" face with double or triple chins gives this man his "baby face." (See
Chart 2) Look carefully at any extremely fat person and you will see that his features
are inclined to the same immaturity of form that characterizes his body.
Very few fat men have long noses. Nearly all fat men and women have not only
shorter, rounder noses but shorter upper lips, fuller mouths, rounder eyes and more
youthful expressions than other people—in short, the features of childhood.
The entire physical makeup of this type is modeled upon the circle—round hands with
dimples where the knuckles are supposed to be; round fingers, round feet, round waist,
round limbs, sloping shoulders, curving thighs, bulging calves, wrists and ankles.

[Pg 40]

Wherever you see curves predominating in the[Pg 41] physical outlines of any person,
that person is largely of the Alimentive type and will always exhibit alimentive traits.
The Man of Few Movements

¶ The Alimentive is a man of unhurried, undulating movements. The difficulty in
moving large bodies quickly necessitates a slowing down of all his activities. These


people are easeful in their actions, make as few moves as possible and thereby lend an
air of restfulness wherever they go.
Because it is difficult to turn their heads, extremely fat people seldom are aware of
what goes on behind them.
The Fat Man's Walk

¶ Very fat people waddle when they walk, though few of them realize it. They can not
watch themselves go by and no one else has the heart to impart bad news to this
pleasant person.
Spilling Over Chairs

¶ The fat man spills over chairs and out of his clothes. Big arm chairs, roomy divans
and capacious automobiles are veritable dykes to these men. Note the bee-line the fat
person makes for the big leather chair when he enters a room![Pg 42]
Clothes for Comfort

¶ The best that money can buy are the kinds of clothes purchased by the Alimentive
whenever he can afford them. And it often happens that he can afford them, especially
if the Cerebral system comes second in his makeup. If he is in middle circumstances
his clothes will be chosen chiefly for comfort. Even the rich Alimentive "gets into
something loose" as soon as he is alone. Baggy trousers, creased sleeves, soft collars
and soft cuffs are seen most frequently on fat men.
Comfort is one of the very first aims of this type. To attain it he often wears old shoes
or gloves long past their time to save breaking in a new pair.
Susceptible to Cold

¶ Cold weather affects this type. If you will look about you the first cold day of
autumn you will note that most of the overcoats are on the plump men.
How the Fat Man Talks

¶ Never to take anything too seriously is an unconscious policy of fat people. They
show it plainly in their actions and speech. The very fat man is[Pg 43] seldom a
brilliant conversationalist. He is often a "jollier" and tells stories well, especially
anecdotes and personal experiences.
Doesn't Tell His Troubles

¶ He seldom relates his troubles and often appears not to have any. He avoids
references to isms and ologies and gives a wide berth to all who deal in them. Radical


groups seldom number any extremely fat men among their members, and when they
do it is usually for some other purpose than those mentioned in the by-laws.
The very fat man dislikes argument, avoids disagreeing with you and sticks to the
outer edges of serious questions in his social conversation.
The Fat Man "Lives to Eat"

¶ Rich food in large quantities is enjoyed by the average fat man three times a day and
three hundred and sixty-five days a year. Between meals he usually manages to stow
away a generous supply of candy, ice cream, popcorn and fruit. We have interviewed
countless popcorn and fruit vendors on this subject and every one of them told us that
the fat people kept them in business.[Pg 44]
Visits the Soda Fountain Often

¶ As for the ice cream business, take a look the next time you pass a soda fountain and
note the large percentage of fat people joyfully scooping up mountains of sundaes,
parfaits and banana splits. You will find that of those who are sipping things through
straws the thin folks are negotiating lemonades and phosphates, while a creamy frappé
is rapidly disappearing from the fat man's glass.
The Deep Mystery

¶ "What do you suppose is making me so plump?" naively inquires the fat man when
it finally occurs to him—as it did to his friends long before—that he is surely and
speedily taking on flesh.
If you don't know the answer, look at the table of any fat person in any restaurant, café
or dining room. He is eating with as much enthusiasm as if he had just been rescued
from a forty-day fast, instead of having only a few hours before looked an equally
generous meal in the eye and put it all under his belt. The next time you are at an
American plan hotel where meals are restricted to certain hours note how the fat
people are always the first ones into the dining room when the doors are opened![Pg
45]
Fat-Making Foods

¶ Butter, olive oil, cream, pastry and starches are foods that increase your weight just
as fast as you eat them, if your assimilative system is anything like it should be.
Though he is the last man in the world who ought to indulge in them the fat man likes
these foods above all others and when compelled to have a meal without them feels as
though he hadn't eaten at all.


Why They Don't Lose Weight

¶ We had a friend who decided to reduce. But in spite of the fact that she lived on
salads almost exclusively for a week she kept right on gaining. We thought she had
been surreptitiously treating herself to lunches between meals until some one noticed
the dressing with which she drowned her lettuce: pure olive oil—a cupful at a
sitting—"because," she said "I must have something tasty to camouflage the stuff."
An Experiment

¶ Once in California, where no city block is complete without its cafeteria, we took a
committee from one of our Human Analysis classes to six of[Pg 46] these big
establishments one noontime. To illustrate to them the authenticity of the facts we
have stated above we prophesied what the fat ones would select for their meals.
Without exception their trays came by heaped with pies, cake, cream, starchy
vegetables and meat, just as we predicted.
A Short Life But a Merry One

¶ According to the statistics of the United States Life Insurance Companies fat people
die younger than others. And the Insurance Companies ought to know, for upon
knowing instead of guessing what it is that takes us off, depends the whole life
insurance business. That they consider the extremely fat man an unsafe risk after thirty
years of age is a well-known fact.
"I am interrupted every day by salesmen for everything on earth except one. But the
life insurance agents leave me alone!" laughed a very fat young lawyer friend of ours
the other morning—and he went on ordering ham and eggs, waffles, potatoes and
coffee!
That he is eating years off his life doesn't trouble the fat man, however. He has such a
good time doing it![Pg 47]
"I Should Worry," Says the Fat Man

¶ It was no accident that "Ish ka bibble" was invented by the Hebrew. For this race has
proportionately more fat people in it than any other and fat people just naturally
believe worry is useless. But the fat man gets this philosophy from the same source
that gives him most of his other traits—his predominating system.
Digestion and Contentment

¶ The eating of delicious food is one of the most intense and poignant pleasures of life.
The digestion of food, when one possesses the splendid machinery for it which
characterizes the Alimentive, gives a deep feeling of serenity and contentment.


Since the fat man is always just going to a big meal or in the process of digesting one
he does not give himself a chance to become ill natured. His own and the world's
troubles sit lightly upon him.
The Most Popular Type Socially

¶ "The life of the party" is the fat man or that pleasing, adaptable, feminine creature,
the fat woman. No matter what comes or goes they have a good time and it is such an
infectious one that others catch it from them.[Pg 48]
Did you ever notice how things pick up when the fat ones appear? Every hostess
anticipates their arrival with pleasure and welcomes them with relief. She knows that
she can relax now, and sure enough, Fatty hasn't his hat off till the atmosphere shows
improvement. By the time Chubby gets into the parlor and passes a few of her sunny
remarks the wheels are oiled for the evening and they don't run down till the last
plump guest has said good night.
¶ So it is no wonder that fat people spend almost every evening at a party. They get so
many more invitations than the rest of us!
Likes Complacent People

¶ People who take things as they find them are the ones the Alimentive prefers for
friends, not only because, like the rest of us, he likes his own kind of folks, but
because the other kind seem incongruous to him. He takes the attitude that resistance
is a waste of energy. He knows other and easier ways of getting what he desires.
There are types who take a lively interest in those who are different from them, but not
the Alimentive. He prefers easy-going, hospitable, complacent friends whose homes
and hearts are always open[Pg 49] and whose minds run on the simple, personal
things.
¶ The reason for this is obvious. All of us like the people, situations, experiences and
environments which bring out our natural tendencies, which call into play those
reflexes and reactions to which we tend naturally.
Chooses Food-Loving Friends

¶ "Let's have something to eat" is a phrase whose hospitality has broken more ice and
warmed more hearts than any other, unless perchance that rapidly disappearing "let's
have something to drink." The fat person keeps at the head of his list those homey
souls who set a good table and excel in the art of third and fourth helpings.
Because he is a very adaptable sort of individual this type can reconcile himself to the
other kind whenever it serves his purpose. But the tenderest spots in his heart are
reserved for those who encourage him in his favorite indoor sport.


When He Doesn't Like You

¶ A fat man seldom dislikes anybody very hard or for very long.
Really disliking anybody requires the expenditure of a good deal of energy and hating
people is the[Pg 50] most strenuous work in the world. So the Alimentive refuses to
take even his dislikes to heart. He is a consistent conserver of steam and this fact is
one of the secrets of his success.
He applies this principle to everything in life. So he travels smoothly through his
dealings with others.
Holds Few Grudges

¶ "Forget it" is another phrase originated by the fat people. You will hear them say it
more often than any other type. And what is more, they excel the rest of us in putting
it into practice. The result is that their nerves are usually in better working order. This
type runs down his batteries less frequently than any other.
Avoids the "Ologists"

¶ When he takes the trouble to think about it there are a few kinds of people the
Alimentive does not care for. The man who is bent on discussing the problems of the
universe, the highbrow who wants to practise his new relativity lecture on him, the
theorist who is given to lengthy expatiations, and all advocates of new isms and
ologies are avoided by the pure Alimentive. He calls them faddists, fanatics and
fools.[Pg 51]
When he sees a highbrow approaching, instead of having it out with him as some of
the other types would, he finds he has important business somewhere else. Thus he
preserves his temperature, something that in the average fat man seldom goes far
above normal.
No Theorist

¶ Theories are the bane of this type. He just naturally doesn't believe in them.
Scientific discoveries, unless they have to do with some new means of adding to his
personal comforts, are taboo. The next time this one about "fat men dying young" is
mentioned in his presence listen to his jolly roar. The speed with which he disposes of
it will be beautiful to see!
"Say, I feel like a million dollars!" he will assure you if you read this chapter to him.
"And I'll bet the folks who wrote that book are a pair of grouches who have forgotten
what a square meal tastes like!"


Where the T-Bones Go

¶ When you catch a three-inch steak homeward bound you will usually find it tucked
under the arm of a well-rounded householder. When his salary positively prohibits the
comforts of parlor,[Pg 52] bedroom and other parts of the house the fat man will still
see to it that the kitchen does not lack for provender.
Describes His Food

¶ The fat person likes to regale you with alluring descriptions of what he had for
breakfast, what he has ordered for lunch and what he is planning for dinner—and the
rarebit he has on the program for after the theater.
Eats His Way to the Grave

¶ Most of us are committing suicide by inches in one form or another—and always in
that form which is inherent in our type.
The Alimentive eats his way to the grave and has at least this much to say for it: it is
more delightful than the pet weaknesses by which the other types hasten the final
curtain.
Diseases He Is Most Susceptible To

¶ Diabetes is more common among this type than any other. Apoplexy comes next,
especially if the fat man is also a florid man with a fast heart or an inclination to high
blood pressure. A sudden breaking down of any or several of the vital organs is
also[Pg 53] likely to occur to fat people earlier than to others. It is the price they pay
for their years of over-eating.
¶ Overtaxed heart, kidneys and liver are inevitable results of too much food.
So the man you call "fat and husky" is fat but not husky, according to the statistics.
Fat Men and Influenza

¶ During the historic Spanish Influenza epidemic of 1918 more fat people succumbed
than all other types combined. This fact was a source of surprise and much discussion
on the part of newspapers, but not of the scientists. The big question in treating this
disease and its twin, Pneumonia, is: will the heart hold out? Fat seriously handicaps
the heart.
The Fat Man's Ford Engine

¶ The human heart weighs less than a pound but it is the one organ in all our
machinery that never takes a rest. It is the engine of the human car, and what a faithful


little motor too—like the Ford engine which it so much resembles. If you live to be
forty it chugs away forty years, and if you stay here ninety it stretches it to ninety,
without an instant of vacation.[Pg 54]
But it must be treated with consideration and the first consideration is not to overwork
it. A Ford engine is large enough for a Ford car, for Fords are light weight. As long as
you do not weigh too much your engine will carry you up the hills and down the dales
of life with good old Ford efficiency and at a pretty good gait.
Making a Truck out of Your Ford

¶ But when you take on fat you are doing to your engine what a Ford driver would be
doing to his if he loaded his car with brick or scrap iron.
A Ford owner who intended to transport bricks the rest of his life could get a bigcylinder engine and substitute it for the original but you can't do that. This little fourcylinder affair is the only one you will ever have and no amount of money, position or
affection can buy you a new one if you mistreat it. Like the Ford engine, it will stand
for a good many pounds of excess baggage and still do good work. But if you load on
too much and keep it there the day will come when its cylinders begin to skip.
¶ You may take it to the service station and pay the doctors to grind the valves, fix
your carbureter and put in some new spark plugs. These may work[Pg 55] pretty well
as long as you are traveling the paved highway of Perfect Health; you may keep up
with the procession without noticing anything particularly wrong.
But come to the hill of Pneumonia or Diabetes and you are very likely not to make the
grade.
Don't "Kill Your Engine"

¶ The records in America show that thousands of men and women literally "kill their
engines" every year when they might have lived many years longer.
How Each Finds Happiness

¶ We live for happiness and each type finds its greatest happiness in following those
innate urges determined by the most highly-developed system in its makeup.
The Alimentive's disposition, nature, character and personality are built by and around
his alimentary system. He is happiest when gratifying it and whenever he thwarts it he
is miserable, just as the rest of us are when we thwart our predominant system.


The World Needs Him

¶ This type has so many traits needed by the world, however, and has such extreme
capacity for[Pg 56] enjoying life that the race, not to mention himself, would profit
greatly by his denying himself excessive amounts of food.
Enjoyment the Keynote of This Type

¶ The good things of life—rich, abundant food and everything that serves the personal
appetites—are the cravings of this type.
He purchases and uses more of the limousines, yachts and chefs than any other three
types combined, and gets more for his money out of them than others do. The keynote
of his nature is personal enjoyment. His senses of touch and taste are also especially
acute.
The Fat Man Loves Comfort

¶ You can tell a great deal about a man's type by noting for what classes of things he
spends most of his extra money.
The Alimentive may have no fire insurance, no Liberty bonds, no real estate but he
will have all the modern comforts he can possibly afford.
Most of the world's millionaires are fat and Human Analysis explains why. We make
few efforts in life save to satisfy our most urgent demands, desires, and ambitions.
Each human type differs in its crav[Pg 57]ings from each of the others and takes the
respective means necessary to gratify these cravings.
The Alimentive craves those luxuries, comforts and conveniences which only money
can procure for him.
The Fat Millionaire

¶ When the Alimentive is a man of brains he uses his brains to get money. No fat
person enjoys work but the greater his brain capacity the more will he forego leisure to
make money.
When the Fat Man is in Average Circumstances

¶ Any man's money-making ambitions depend largely on whether money is essential
to the satisfaction of his predominating instincts.
If he is fat and of average brain capacity he will overcome his physical inertia to the
point of securing for himself and his family most of the comforts of modern life.


The average-brained fat man composes a large percentage of our population and the
above accounts for his deserved reputation as a generous husband and father.
The Fat Man a Good Provider

¶ The fat man will give his last cent to his wife[Pg 58] and children for the things they
desire but he is not inclined as much as some other types to hearken to the woes of the
world at large. The fat man is essentially a family man, a home man, a respectable,
cottage-owning, tax-paying, peaceable citizen.
Not a Reformer

¶ He inclines to the belief that other families, other communities, other classes and
other countries should work out their own salvation and he leaves them to do it. In all
charitable, philanthropic and community "drives" he gives freely but is not lavish nor
sentimental about it. It is often a "business proposition" with him.
When the Fat Man is Poor

¶ Love of ease is the fat man's worst enemy. His inherent contentment, accentuated by
the inconvenience of moving about easily or quickly, constantly tempts him to let
things slide. When he lacks the brain capacity for figuring out ways and means for
getting things easily he is never a great success at anything.
When the extremely fat man's mentality is below the average he often refuses to
work—in which case he becomes a familiar figure around public[Pg 59] rest rooms,
parks and the cheaper hotel lobbies. Such a man finally graduates into the class of
professional chair-warmers.
Fat People Love Leisure

¶ A chance to do as we please, especially to do as little hard work as possible, is a
secret desire of almost everybody. But the fat man takes the prize for wanting it most.
Not a Strenuous Worker

¶ He is not constructed to work hard like some of the other types, as we shall see in
subsequent chapters. His overweight is not only a handicap in that it slows down his
movements, but it tends to slow down all his vital processes as well and to overload
his heart. This gives him a chronic feeling of heaviness and inertia.
Everybody Likes Him

¶ But Nature must have intended fat people to manage the rest of us instead of taking a
hand at the "heavy work." She made them averse to toil and then made them so likable
that they can usually get the rest of us to do their hardest work for them.[Pg 60]


The World Managed by Fat People

¶ When he is brainy the fat man never stays in the lower ranks of subordinates. He
may get a late start in an establishment but he will soon make those over him like him
so well they will promote him to a chief-clerkship, a foremanship or a managership.
Once there he will make those under him so fond of him that they will work long and
hard for him.
Fat Men to the Top

¶ In this way the fat man of real brains goes straight to the top while others look on
and bewail the fact that they do most of the actual work. They fail to recognize that
the world always pays the big salaries not for hand work but for head work, and not so
much for working yourself as for your ability to get others to work.
The Popular Politician

¶ This capacity for managing, controlling and winning others is what enables this type
to succeed so well in politics. The fat man knows how to get votes. He mixes with
everybody, jokes with everybody, remembers to ask how the children are—and pretty
soon he's the head of his ward. Almost every big political boss is fat.[Pg 61]
Makes Others Work

¶ One man is but one man and at best can do little more than a good man-size day of
work. But a man who can induce a dozen other man-machines to speed up and turn
out a full day's work apiece doesn't need to work his own hands. He serves his
employer more valuably as an overseer, foreman or supervisor.
The Fat Salesman

¶ "A fat drummer" is such a common phrase that we would think our ears deceived us
did anyone speak of a thin one. Approach five people and say "A traveling salesman,"
each will tell you that the picture this conjures in his imagination is of a fat, round,
roly-poly, good natured, pretty clever man whom everybody likes.
For the fat men are "born salesmen" and they make up a large percentage of that
profession. Salesmanship requires mentality plus a pleasing personality. The fat man
qualifies easily in the matter of personality. Then he makes little or much money from
salesmanship, according to his mental capacity.
The Drummers' Funny Stories

¶ You will note that the conversation of fat people[Pg 62] is well sprinkled with funny
stories. They enjoy a good joke better than any other type, for a reason which will
become more and more apparent to you.


¶ That salesmen are popularly supposed to regale each customer with yarns till he
gasps for breath and to get his signature on the dotted line while he is in that weakened
condition, is more or less of a myth. It originated from the fact that most salesmen are
fat and that fat people tell stories well.
Jokes at Fat Men's Expense

¶ "Look at Fatty," "get a truck," and other jibes greet the fat man on every hand. He
knows he can not proceed a block without being the butt of several jokes, but he
listens to them all with an amiability surprising to other types. And this good nature is
so apparent that even those who make sport of him are thinking to themselves: "I
believe I'd like that man."
The Fat Man's Habits

¶ "Never hurry and never worry" are the unconscious standards underlying many of
the reactions of this type. If you will compile a list of the habits of any fat person you
will find that they are mostly the outgrowths of one or both of these motives.[Pg 63]
Won't Speed Up

¶ You would have a hard time getting an Alimentive to follow out any protracted line
of action calling for strenuosity, speed or high tension. He will get as much done as
the strenuous man when their mentalities are equal—and often more. The fat person
keeps going in a straight line, with uniform and uninterrupted effort, and does not
have the blow-outs common to more fidgety people. But hard, fast labor is not in his
line.
Loves Comedy

¶ All forms of mental depression are foreign to fat people as long as they are in normal
health. We have known a fat husband and wife to be ejected for rent and spend the
evening at the movies laughing like four-year-olds at Charlie Chaplin or a Mack
Sennett comedy. You have sometimes seen fat people whose financial condition was
pretty serious and wondered how they could be so cheerful.
Inclined to Indolence

¶ Fat people's habits, being built around their points of strength and weakness, are
necessarily of two kinds—the desirable and the undesirable.[Pg 64]
The worst habits of this type are those inevitable to the ease-loving and the immatureminded.
Indolence is one of his most undesirable traits and costs the Alimentive dear.


In this country where energy, push and lightning-like efficiency are at a premium only
the fat man of brains can hope to keep up.
The inertia caused by his digestive processes is so great that it is almost
insurmountable. The heavy, lazy feeling you have after a large meal is with the fat
man interminably because his organism is constantly in the process of digesting large
amounts of food.
Likes Warm Rooms

¶ Love of comfort—especially such things as warm rooms and soft beds—is so deeply
imbedded in the fiber of this type that he has ever to face a fight with himself which
the rest of us do not encounter. This sometimes leads the excessively corpulent person
to relax into laziness and slovenliness. An obese individual sometimes surprises us,
however, by his ambition and immaculateness.
But such a man or woman almost always combines decided mental tendencies with his
alimentiveness.[Pg 65]
Enjoys Doing Favors

¶ The habits which endear the fat person to everyone and make us forget his faults are
his never-failing hospitality, kindness when you are in trouble, his calming air of
contentment, his tact, good nature and the real pleasure he seems to experience when
doing you a favor.
His worst faults wreak upon him far greater penalties than fall upon those who
associate with him, something that can not be said of the faults of some other types.
Likes Melody

¶ Simple, natural music is a favorite with fat people. Love songs, rollicking tunes and
those full of melody are most popular with them. An easy-to-learn, easy-to-sing song
is the one a fat man chooses when he names the next selection.
They like ragtime, jazz and music with a swing to it. Music the world over is most
popular with fat races. The world's greatest singers and most of its famous musicians
have been fat or at least decidedly plump.
Goes to the Cabaret

¶ The fat person will wiggle his toes, tap his[Pg 66] fingers, swing his fork and nod
his head by the hour with a rumbling jazz orchestra.
When the Alimentive is combined with some other type he will also enjoy other kinds
of music but the pure Alimentive cares most for primal tunes and melodies.


Likes a Girly-Show

¶ A pretty-girl show makes a hit with fat women as well as with fat men. Drop into the
"Passing Show" and note how many fat people are in the audience. Drop into a theater
the next night where a tragedy is being enacted and see how few fat ones are there.
The One Made Sport Of

¶ Fat people enjoy helping out the players, if the opportunity offers. All show people
know this.
When one of those tricks is to be played from the foot-lights upon a member of the
audience the girl who does it is always careful to select that circular gentleman down
front. Let her try to mix up confetti or a toy balloon with a tall skinny man and the
police would get a hurry call!
When we describe the bony type you will note how very different he is from our
friend the fat man.[Pg 67]
A Movie Fan

¶ "The fat man's theater" would be a fitting name for the movie houses of the country.
Not that the fat man is the only type patronizing the cinema. The movies cover in one
evening so many different kinds of human interests—news, cartoons, features and
comedy—that every type finds upon the screen something to interest him.
But if you will do what we have done—stand at the doorway of the leading movie
theaters of your city any evening and keep a record of the types that enter you will
find the plump are as numerous as all the others combined.
Easy Entertainment

¶ The reason for this is plain to all who are acquainted with Human Analysis: the fat
man wants everything the easiest possible way and the movie fulfils this requirement
more fully than any other theatrical entertainment. He can drop in when he feels like it
and there is no waiting for the show to start, for one thing.
This is a decided advantage to him, for fat people do not like to depend upon
themselves for entertainment.[Pg 68]
The Babies of the Race

¶ The first stage in biological evolution was the stage in which the alimentary
apparatus was developed. To assimilate nutriment was the first function of all life and
is so still, since it is the principal requirement for self-preservation.


Being the first and most elemental of our five physiological systems the Alimentive—
when it overtops the others—produces a more elemental, infantile nature. The pure
Alimentive has rightly been called "the baby of the race." This accounts for many of
the characteristics of the extremely fat person, including the fact that it is difficult for
him to amuse himself.
He of all types likes most to be amused and very simple toys and activities are
sufficient to do it.
Loves the Circus

¶ A serious drama or "problem play" usually bores him but he seldom misses a circus.
The fat person expresses his immaturity also in that he likes to be petted, made over
and looked after.
¶ Like the infant he demands food first. Almost the only time a fat man loses his
temper is when he has been deprived of his food. The next demand on[Pg 69] his list
is sleep, another characteristic of the immature.
Give a fat man "three squares" a day and plenty of sleep in a comfortable bed, and he
will walk off with the prize for good humor three hundred and sixty-five days in the
year. Next to sleep he demands warm clothing in winter and steam heat when the
wintry winds blow.
Fat People at the Beach

¶ If it were not for the exertion required in getting to and from the beaches, dressing
and undressing, and the momentary coldness of the water, many more Alimentives
would go to the beaches in Summer than do.
Not Strenuous

¶ Anything, to be popular with the Alimentive, must be easy to get, easy to do, easy to
get away from, easy to drop if he feels like it. Anything requiring the expenditure of
great energy, even though it promises pleasure when achieved, is usually passed over
by the fat people.
The Art of Getting Out Of It

¶ "Let George do it" is another bit of slang invented by this type. He seldom does
anything he[Pg 70] really hates to do. He is so likable he either induces you to let him
out of it or gets somebody to do it for him. He just naturally avoids everything that is
intense, difficult or strenuous.


The Peaceable Type

¶ If an unpleasant situation of a personal or social nature arises—a quarrel, a
misunderstanding or any kind of disagreement—the fat man will try to get himself out
of it without a discussion.
Except when they have square faces (in which case they are not pure Alimentives),
extremely fat people do not mix up in neighborhood, family, church, club or political
quarrels. It is too much trouble, for one thing, and for another it is opposed to his
peaceable, untensed nature.
Avoids Expensive Quarrels

¶ The fat man has his eye on personal advantages and promotions and he knows that
quarrels are expensive, not alone in the chances they lose him, but in nerve force and
peace of mind.
The fat man knows instinctively that peace times are the most profitable times and
though he is not for "peace at any price" so far as the country is concerned, he
certainly is much inclined that way[Pg 71] where he is personally concerned. You will
be amused to notice how this peace-loving quality increases as one's weight increases.
The more fat any individual is the more is he inclined to get what he wants without
hostility.
The Real Thing

¶ The favorite "good time" of the Alimentive is one where there are plenty of
refreshments. A dinner invitation always makes a hit with him, but beware that you do
not lure a fat person into your home and give him a tea-with-lemon wisp where he
expected a full meal!
Always Ready for Food

¶ Substantial viands can be served to him any hour of the day or night with the
certainty of pleasing him. He loves a banquet, provided he is not expected to make a
speech. The fat man has a harder time than any other listening to long speeches.
The fashion of trying to mix the two most opposite extremes—food and ideas—and
expecting them to go down, was due to our misunderstanding of the real nature of
human beings. It is rapidly going out, as must every fashion which fails to take the
human instincts into account.[Pg 72]
Avoids Sports

¶ No prizes lure a fat man into strenuous physical exercise or violent sports. Although
we have witnessed numerous state, national and international tennis, polo, rowing,


sprinting, hurdling and swimming contests, we have seen not one player who was fat
enough to be included in the pure Alimentive type.
The grand-stands, bleachers and touring cars at these contests contained a generous
number of fat people, but their conversation indicated that they were present more
from personal interest in some contestant than in the game itself.
The nearest a fat man usually comes to taking strenuous exercise is to drive in an open
car. The more easeful that car the better he likes it. He avoids long walks as he would
the plague, and catches a street car for a two-block trip.
The Personal Element

¶ Due to his immaturity, the fat person gives little thought to anything save those
things which affect him personally.
The calm exterior, unruffled countenance and air of deliberation he sometimes wears,
and which have[Pg 73] occasionally passed for "judicial" qualities, are largely the
results of the fact that the Alimentive refuses to get stirred up over anything that does
not concern him personally.
This personal element will be found to dominate the activities, conversation and
interests of the Alimentive. For him to like a thing or buy a thing it must come pretty
near being something he can eat, wear, live in or otherwise personally enjoy. He
confines himself to the concrete and tangible. But most of all he confines himself to
things out of which he gets something for himself.
Reading

¶ The fat man is no reader but when he does read it is nearly always something funny,
simple or sentimental. In newspapers he reads the "funnies." Magazine stories, if short
and full of sentiment, attract him. He seldom reads an editorial and is not a book
worm. The newspaper furnishes practically all of the fat man's reading. He seldom
owns a library unless he is very rich, and then it is usually for "show."
Avoids Book Stores

¶ In making the investigations for this course, we interviewed many clerks in the
bookstores of leading[Pg 74] cities throughout the United States. Without exception
they stated that few extremely fat people patronized them. "I have been in this store
seventeen years and I have never sold a book to a two hundred and fifty pounder," one
dealer told us. All this is due to the fact with which we started this chapter—that the
fat man is built around his stomach—and stomachs do not read!


Naturally Realistic

¶ The fat man has the child's natural innocence and ignorance of subtle and elusive
things. He has the same interest in things and people as does the child; the child's
indifference to books, lectures, schools and everything abstract.
Physical Assets

¶ "I believe I could digest nails!" exclaimed a fat friend of ours recently. This perfect
nutritive system constitutes the greatest physical superiority of the Alimentive. So
highly developed is his whole stomach department that everything "agrees" with him.
And everything tends to make him fat.
As Irvin Cobb recently said: "It isn't true that one can't have his cake and eat it, too,
for the fat man eats his and keeps it—all."[Pg 75]
Physical Liabilities

¶ A tendency to over-eat results naturally from the highly developed eating and
digesting system of this type but this in turn overtaxes all the vital organs, as stated
before. Also, the fat man's aversion to exercise reduces his physical efficiency.
The pure Alimentive and the alimentively-inclined should learn their normal weight
and then keep within it if they desire long lives.
Social Assets

¶ Sweetness of disposition is one of the most valuable of all human characteristics. Fat
people possess it more often and more unchangingly than any other type. Other social
assets of this type are amenableness, affability, hospitality and approachableness.
Social Liabilities

¶ Gaining his ends by flattery, cajolery, and various more or less innocent little
deceptions are the only social handicaps of this type.
Emotional Assets

¶ His unfailing optimism is the most marked emotional quality of this type. Nothing
can be so dark that the fat person doesn't find a silver edge[Pg 76] somewhere. So in
disaster we always send for our fat friends. In the presence of an amply-proportioned
individual everything looks brighter. Hope springs eternal in human breasts but the
springs are stronger in the plump folks than in the rest of us.
Money spending is also a marked feature of the fat man. His emotions are out-going,
never "in-growing." A stingy fat man is unknown.


Emotional Liabilities

¶ A tendency to become spoiled, to pout, and to take out his resentments in babyish
ways are the emotional weaknesses of this type. These, as you will note, are the
natural reactions of childhood, from which he never fully emerges.
Business Assets

¶ The ability to make people like him is the greatest business and professional asset of
this type, and one every other type might well emulate. One average-minded fat man
near the door of a business establishment will make more customers in a month by his
geniality, joviality and sociableness than a dozen brilliant thinkers will in a year.
Every business that deals directly with the public should have at least one fat person in
it.[Pg 77]
Business Liabilities

¶ A habit of evading responsibility and of "getting out from under" constitutes the
inclination most harmful to the business or professional ambitions of this type. Again
it is the child in him trying to escape the task set for it and at the same time to avoid
punishment.
Domestic Strength

¶ Love of home is a distinguishing domestic trait of all fat people. The fat man's
provision for his family is usually as complete as his circumstances will permit and he
often stretches it a point.
As parents fat men and women are almost too easy-going for their own future
happiness, for they "spoil" their children. But they are more loved by their children
than any other type. Being so nearly children themselves they make equals of their
children, enter into their games and live their lives with them.
Domestic Weakness

¶ Dependence on others, the tendency of allowing one's self to be supported by
brothers or sisters or wife, is the chief domestic weakness of fat people. They should
begin early in life to depend upon them[Pg 78]selves and make it a practice to carry
their share of family responsibilities.
Should Aim At

¶ Developing more of his mental powers with a view to using his head to lessen the
manual work he so dislikes, and cultivating an interest in the more mature side of the
world in which he lives should be two of the aims of all extremely fat people.


Should Avoid

¶ "Letting down," soft snaps and temptations to evade responsibility should be
avoided by the fat. Elbert Hubbard said, "Blessed is the man who is not looking for a
soft snap, for he is the only one who shall find it." This explains why the fat man,
unless brainy, seldom lands one.
Strongest Points

¶ Optimism, hospitality and harmony are the strongest points in the fat man's nature.
Upon them many a man has built a successful life. Without them no individual of any
type can hope to be happy.
His popularity and all-around compatibility give the fat man advantages over other
types which fairly compensate for the weak cogs in his machinery.[Pg 79]
Weakest Points

¶ Self-indulgence of all kinds, over-eating, over-sleeping, under-exercising and the
evasion of responsibilities are the weakest points of this type. Despite his many strong
points his life is often wrecked on these rocks. He so constantly tends to taking the
easy way out. Day by day he gives up chances for ultimate success for the baubles of
immediate ease.
He is the most likable of all the types but his indolence sometimes strains even the
love of his family to the breaking point.
How to Deal with this Type Socially

¶ Feed him, give him comfortable chairs—the largest you have—and don't drag him
into long discussions of any kind. This is the recipe for winning the fat man when you
meet him socially.
And whatever you do, don't tell him your troubles! The fat man hates trouble,
smothers his own, and you only make him ill at ease when you regale him with yours.
Don't walk him any more than is absolutely necessary. Let him go home early if he
starts. He enjoys his sleep and doesn't like to have it interfered with.
¶ Make your conversation deal with concrete per[Pg 80]sonal things and events. Stay
away from highbrow subjects. The best places to eat and the best shows of the week
are safe subjects to introduce when with very fat people.


How to Deal with this Type in Business

¶ Don't give him hard manual tasks. If you want this kind of work done get some one
other than an extremely fat man to do it. If you hire a fat man blame yourself for the
result.
Give your fat employee a chance to deal with people in a not-too-serious way, but
hold him strictly to the keeping of his records, reports and working hours. If this fat
person is a dealer, a merchant or a tradesman keep him to his word. Start out by letting
him know you expect the delivery of just what he promises. Don't let him "jolly" you
into relinquishing what is rightfully yours. And keep in mind always that the fat
person is usually good at heart.
[Pg 81]
Remember, the chief distinguishing
marks of the Alimentive in the order
of their importance are ROUNDED
OUTLINES, IMMATURE FEATURES
and DIMPLED HANDS. A person
who has these is largely of the Alimentive
type, no matter what other types
may be included in his makeup.

[Pg 83]

CHAPTER II

The Thoracic Type
"The Thriller"


ndividuals in whom the circulatory system (heart, arteries and blood vessels) and the
respiratory system (lungs, nose and chest) are more highly developed than any other
systems, have been named the Thoracics.
¶ This name comes from the fact that the heart and lungs (which constitute the most
important organs of these two closely-allied systems) are housed in the thorax—that
little room made by your ribs for the protection of these vital organs.
Physical Resilience

¶ A general elasticity of structure, a suggestion of sinews and physical resilience
characterizes this type.
The Florid-Faced, High-Chested Individual

¶ What is known as a "red face," when accompanied by a high chest, always signifies
large thoracic tendencies. The high color which in an adult[Pg 84] comes and goes is a
sure indication of a well developed circulatory system, since high color is caused by
the rapid pumping of blood to the tiny blood vessels of the face.
People with little blood, weak hearts or deficient circulation are not florid and must be
much overheated or excited to show vivid color in their cheeks.
Betray Their Feelings

¶ On the other hand, the slightest displeasure, enjoyment, surprise or exertion brings
the blood rushing to the face and neck of him who has a large, well-developed bloodsystem. How many times you have heard such a one say: "I am so embarrassed! I
flush at every little thing! How I envy the rest of you who come in from a long walk
looking so cool!"
The Man of Great Chest Expansion

¶ The largest part of this man's body is around the chest. (See Chart 3) His chest is
high for the reason that he has larger lungs than the average.
Advantages of a High Chest

¶ The man of unusual chest-expansion has one great physical asset. The person who
breathes[Pg 85] deeply has a decided advantage over the man who breathes
deficiently. The lungs form the bellows or air-supply for the body's engine, the heart,
and with a deficient supply of air the heart does deficient work. Efficient breathing is
easy only to the man of large lungs, and only the high chested have large lungs.


Long-Waisted People

¶ A long waist is another thoracic sign, for it is a natural result of the extra houseroom required by the large lungs and heart. It is easily detected in both men and
women. (See Chart 3)
If you are a close observer you have noticed that some people appear to have a waist
line much lower than others; that the belt line dividing the upper part of the body from
the lower is proportionately much nearer the floor in some than in others of the same
height.
Passing of the "Wasp Waist"

¶ The "straight-up-and-down" lines of today's woman and the slimpsy shoulder-toheel garments she wears have obliterated her waistline, but you will recall how
differently the old "wasp waist" fashions of a score of years ago betrayed the secrets
of the short and long waist.[Pg 86]
The eighteen-inch belt, of which we were so falsely proud in 1900, told unmistakable
facts about milady's thoracic development.
Belts vs. Suspenders

¶ As the tell-tale belt disappeared from woman's wardrobe it appeared in man's, and
now betrays the location of his waist with an exactness of which the old-fashioned
suspenders were never guilty.
To Test Yourself

¶ If you are a man and have difficulty in getting ready-made coats long enough for
you this is certain proof that you have decided thoracic tendencies. If you are a woman
who has to forego many a pretty gown because it is not long enough in the waist, the
same is true of you.
In women this long waist and high chest give the appearance of small hips and of
shoulders a little broader than the average; in men it gives that straight, soldier-like
bearing which makes this type of man admired and gazed after as he strides down the
street.
The Pure Thoracic Head

¶ A high head is a significant characteristic of the[Pg 87] typical Thoracic. (See Chart
4) The Anglo-Saxons tend to have this head and, more than any other races, exhibit
thoracic qualities as racial characteristics.


This is considered the handsomest head known. Certainly it lends the appearance of
nobility and intelligence. It is not wide, looked at from the front or back, but inclines
to be slightly narrower for its height than the Alimentive head.
The Kite-Shaped Face

¶ A face widest through the cheek bones and tapering slightly up the sides of the
forehead and downward to the jaw bones is the face of the pure Thoracic. (See Chart
4) This must not be mistaken for the pointed chin nor the pointed head, but is merely a
sloping of the face upward and downward from the cheek bones as a result of the
unusual width of the nose section. (See Chart 4)
His Well-Developed Nose

¶ The nose section is also high and wide because the typical Thoracic has a nose that
is well developed. This is shown not only by its length but by its high bridge.

[Pg 88]


The cause for the width and length of this section[Pg 89] is obvious. The nose
constitutes the entrance and exit departments of the breathing system. Large lung
capacity necessitates a large chamber for the intake and expulsion of air.
Signs of Good Lungs

¶ Whenever you see a man whose face is wide through the cheek bones—with a long,
high-bridged open-nostrilled nose—you see a man of good lung capacity and of quick
physical energy. When you see any one with pinched nostrils, a face that is narrow
through the cheek bones and a low or "sway-back" nose, you see a man whose lung
capacity is deficient. Such a person invariably expends his physical energy more
slowly.
Freckles, being due to the same causes as red hair and high color, are further
indications of thoracic tendencies, though you may belong to this type with or without
them.
The Typical Thoracic Hand

¶ The pointed hand is the hand of the pure Thoracic. (See Chart 4) Note the extreme
length of the second finger and the pointed effect of this hand when all the fingers are
laid together. Any person with a pointed hand such as this has good[Pg 90] thoracic
development whether it occupies first place in his makeup or not.
The fingers of the Thoracic are also inclined to be more thin-skinned than those of
other types.
One may be predominantly Thoracic without these elements but they are indications
of the extreme Thoracic type. Naturally the hand of the extreme Thoracic is more pink
than the average.
The Beautiful Foot

¶ The Thoracic tends to have more narrow, high-arched feet than other types. As a
result this type makes the majority of the beautifully shod.
The Man of Energetic Movements

¶ A hair-trigger nimbleness goes with this type. He is always "poised ready to strike."
All Thoracics use their hands, arms, wrists, limbs and feet alertly and energetically.
They open doors, handle implements and all kinds of hand instruments with little
blundering. Also their movements are more graceful than those of other types.


The Thoracic Walk

¶ "The springy step" must have been invented to describe the walk of the Thoracic. No
matter[Pg 91] how hurried, his walk has more grace than the walk of other types. He
does not stumble; and it is seldom that a Thoracic steps on the train of his partner's
gown.
The Graceful Sitter

¶ The way you sit tells a great deal about your nature. One of the first secrets it betrays
is whether you are by nature graceful or ungainly. The person who sits gracefully,
who seems to drape himself becomingly upon a chair and to arise from it with ease is
usually a Thoracic.
Their excess of energy sometimes gives them the appearance of "fidgeting," but it is
an easy, graceful fidget and not as disturbing as that of other types.
Keen Eye and Ear Senses

¶ Quick eyes and keen ears are characteristic of the Thoracics. The millions of
stimuli—the sounds, sights and smells impinging every waking moment upon the
human consciousness—affect him more quickly and more intensely than any other
type. The acuteness of all our senses depends, to a far greater extent than we have
hitherto supposed, upon proper heart and lung action.[Pg 92]
Take long, deep breaths for five minutes in the open air while walking rapidly enough
to make your heart pound, and see how much keener your senses are at the end of that
time.
The Thoracic is chronically in this condition because his heart and lungs are going at
top speed habitually and naturally all his life.
Susceptible to Heat

¶ Because bodily temperature varies according to the amount of blood and the rapidity
of its circulation, this type is always warmer than others. He is extremely susceptible
to heat, suffers keenly in warm rooms or warm weather and wears fewer wraps in
winter. The majority of bathers at the beaches in summer are largely of this type.
The High-Strung

¶ Nerves as taut as a violin string—due to his acute physical senses and his thin,
sensitive skin—plus his instantaneous quickness make the Thoracic what is known as
"high-strung."


The Most Temperamental

¶ Because he is keyed to high C by nature, the Thoracic has more of that quality called
temperament than any other type.[Pg 93]
The wag who said that "temperament was mostly temper" might have reversed it and
still have been right. For temper is largely a matter of temperament. Since the
Thoracics have more "temperament" it follows naturally that they have more temper,
or rather that they show it oftener, just as they show their delightful qualities oftener.
A Continuous Performance

¶ This type, consciously and unconsciously, is a "continuous performance." He is
showing you something of himself every moment and if you are interested in human
nature, as your reading of this book suggests, you are going to find him a fascinating
subject. He is expressing his feelings with more or less abandon all the time and he is
likely to express as many as a dozen different ones in as many moments.
The Quick Temper

¶ "Flying off the handle," and "going up in the air" are phrases originally inspired by
our dear, delightful friends, the Thoracics.
Other types do these more or less temperamental things but they do not do them as
frequently nor on as short notice as this type.[Pg 94]
The Human Firefly

¶ A fiery nature is part and parcel of the Thoracic's makeup. But did you ever see a
fiery-natured man who didn't have lots of warm friends! It is the grouch—in whom the
fire starts slowly and smoulders indefinitely—that nobody likes. But the man who
flares up, flames for a moment and is calm the next never lacks for companions or
devotees.
The Red-Haired

¶ One may belong to the Thoracic type whether his hair is blonde or brunette or any of
the shades between, but it is an interesting fact that most of the red-haired are largely
of this type. "He didn't have red hair for nothing" is a famous phrase that has been
applied to the red-haired, quick-tempered Thoracic for generations.
You will be interested to note that this high color and high chest are distinctly
noticeable in most of the red-haired people you know—certain proof that they
approximate this type.


As you walk down the street tomorrow look at the people ahead of you and when you
find a "red-head" notice how much more red his neck is than[Pg 95] the necks of the
people walking beside him. This flushed skin almost always accompanies red hair,
showing that most red-haired people belong to this type.
The "Flash in the Pan"

¶ The red-haired man's temper usually expends itself instantly. His red-hot fieriness is
over in a moment. But for every enemy he has two friends—friends who like his
flame, even though in constant danger from it themselves.
Whereas the Alimentive avoids you if he disagrees with you, the Thoracic likes to tell
you in a few hot words just what he thinks of you. But the chances are that he will be
so completely over it by lunch time that he will invite you out with him.
Desire for Approbation

¶ To be admired and a wee bit envied are desires dear to the heart of this type.
Everybody, to a greater or lesser degree, desires these things, but to no other type do
they mean so much as to this one. We know this because no other type, in any such
numbers, takes the trouble or makes the sacrifices necessary to bring them about.[Pg
96]
Acts Indicate Desires

¶ The ego of every individual craves approval but the majority of the other types
craves something else more—the particular something in each case depending upon
the type to which the individual belongs.
You can always tell what any individual WANTS MOST by what he DOES. The man
who thinks he wants a thing or wishes he wanted it talks about getting it, envies those
who have it and plans to start doing something about it. But the man who really
WANTS a thing GOES AFTER it, sacrifices his leisure, his pleasures and sometimes
love itself—and GETS it.
Shines in Public Life

¶ The lime-light appeals more to this type than to others because it goes further toward
gratifying his desire for approbation. So while other men and women are dreaming of
fame the Thoracic practises, ploughs and pleads his way to it.
The personal adulation of friends and of the multitude is the breath of life to him.
Extremes of this type consider no self-denial too great a price to pay for it.[Pg 97]


Many on the Stage

¶ The stage in all its forms is as natural a field to the Thoracic as salesmanship is to
the Alimentive. The pleas of fond papas and fearsome mamas are usually ineffective
with this type of boy or girl when he sets his heart on a career before the foot-lights or
in the movies.
Whether they achieve it or not will depend on other, and chiefly mental, traits in each
individual's makeup, but the yearning for it in some form is always there. So the
managers' waiting rooms are always crowded with people of this type. It is this
intensity of desire which has goaded and inspired most stage artists on to success in
their chosen fields.
"Put Yourself in His Place"

¶ To be able to put one's self in the role of another, to feel as he feels; to be so keenly
sensitive to his situation and psychology that one almost becomes that person for the
time being, is the heart and soul of acting.
The Thoracic has this sensitiveness naturally. After long study and acquaintance you
may be able to put yourself in the place of a few friends. The Thoracic does this
instantly and automatically.[Pg 98]
Tendency, Not Toil, Makes Fame

¶ Those who have succeeded to fame in any given line are wont to proclaim, "Hard
work is the secret of success," and to take great credit unto themselves for the labor
they have expended on their own.
It is true of course that all success entails hard work. But the man or woman
sufficiently gifted to rise to the heights gets from that gift such a strong inward urge
towards its expression that what he does in that direction is not work to him. The long
hours, concentration and study devoted to it are more pleasurable than painful to him.
He chooses such activities voluntarily.
Nature the Real Artist

¶ Nothing can rightly be called work which one does out of sheer preference. Work
never made an actress and work never made a singer where innate talent for these arts
was lacking. Nature, the true maker of every famous name, bestows ninety per cent
and man, if he hustles, can provide the other very necessary ten. But his sense of
humor if not his sense of justice should be sufficient to prevent his trying to rob the
Almighty of His due.[Pg 99]


Success for All

¶ Every individual who is not feeble-minded can be a success at something in this big
world. Every normal-minded individual is able to create, invent, improve, organize,
build or market some of the myriads of things the world is crying for. But he will
succeed at only those things in which his physiological and psychological mechanisms
perform their functions easily and naturally.
Why We Work

¶ Man is, by inclination, very little of a worker. He is, first, a wanter—a bundle of
instincts; second, a feeler—a bundle of emotions; last and least, he is a thinker. What
real work he does is done not because he likes it but because it serves one of these first
two bundles of instincts.
When the desire for leisure is stronger than the other urges, leisure wins. But in all
ambitious men and women the desire for other things outweighs the leisure-urge.
Ambition and Type

¶ Now what is it that causes some to have ambition and others to lack it?
Your ambitions take the form determined by your[Pg 100] predominating
physiological system. For instance, in every great singer the Thoracic has been present
either as the first or second element.
The effect of the physical upon our talents is no more marked anywhere than here. For
it is his unusual lung power, his high chest, the sounding boards in his nose section
and his superior vocal cords that make the real foundation of every singer's fame.
These physiological conditions are found in extreme degree only in persons of
thoracic tendencies.
It was the great lung-power of Caruso that made him a great singer. It was his
remarkable heart-power that brought him through an illness in February, 1921, when
every newspaper in the world carried on its front page the positive statement that he
could not live another day. That he lived for six months afterward was due chiefly to
his remarkable heart.
The nature resulting from a large heart and large lungs is one distinctly different from
all others—in short, the Thoracic nature.
The Best Dressed

¶ The best dressed man and the best dressed woman in your town belong
predominantly to this[Pg 101] type. This is no accident. The Thoracics, being


possessed of acute eye senses, are more sensitive to color and line than any other type.
These are the foundations of "style" and artistic grooming.
Clothes Can Unmake the Man

¶ Being desirous of the approval of others and realizing that though clothes do not
make the man they can unmake him, this type looks to his laurels on this point.
Because clothes determine the first impressions we make upon strangers and because
that impression is difficult to change, clothes are of vast importance in this maze of
human relationships.
The Thoracic is more sensitive to the attitude of others because their attitude is more
vital to his self-expression. He senses from childhood the bearing that clothes have for
or against him in the opinion of others and how they can aid him to express his
personality.
The Glass of Fashion

¶ The Thoracic therefore often becomes "the glass of fashion and the mold of form."
His consciousness of himself is so keen that, even when alone, he prefers those things
in dress which are at once fine, fancy and fashionable.[Pg 102]
Some types are indifferent to clothes, some ignorant of clothes and some defiant in
their clothes but the Thoracic always has a keen sense of fitness in the matter of
apparel.
Distinction in Dress

¶ The distinctive dresser is one who essays the extremely fashionable, the "last
moment" touch. He is always a step or two ahead of the times. His ties, handbags,
handkerchiefs and stick pins are "up to the minute." Such a man or woman invariably
has a large thoracic development and is well repaid by the public for his pains.
Dress the Universal Language

¶ The public looks more eagerly than we suppose to changes in styles and fads. It
gives, in spite of itself, instantaneous admiration of a sort to those who follow the
dictates of fashion. This being one of the quickest roads to adulation, it is often
utilized by this type.
The Newest in Hairdressing

¶ The latest thing in coiffures is always known by the Thoracic woman. And because
she is, more often than any other type, a beautiful woman she[Pg 103] can wear her
hair in almost any style and find it becoming.


So when puffs were the thing this type of woman not only wore puffs but the most
extreme and numerous puffs. When the "sticking-to-the-face" style was in vogue she
bought much bandoline and essayed the sleekest and shiniest head of all. When the
ear-bun raged she changed those same paper-like curls over night into veritable young
sofa cushions.
Always on "Dress Parade"

¶ With intent to keep the spotlight on himself the Thoracic is always on dress parade.
He is vividly aware of himself; he knows what kind of picture he is making. He is
seldom "self-conscious," in the sense of being timid. When he does happen to be timid
he suffers, by reason of his greater desire for approval, more acutely than any other
type.
Affectability His Keynote

¶ Instantaneous reaction to stimuli—with all the reflex actions resulting therefrom—
constitutes the keynote of this type. This makes an individual who is physiologically
and psychologically affectable.[Pg 104]
Because life is full of all kinds of stimuli, acting during every waking moment upon
every sense in the organism, any person who is high strung finds himself in the midst
of what might be called "nerve-bedlam."
Gets the Most Out of Everything

¶ Because of this same highly sensitized makeup the Thoracic gets more sensations
out of every incident than the rest of us do. He experiences more joy in the space of a
lifetime but also more disappointment.
The Human Violin

¶ For the same reason that the violin vibrates to a greater number of sounds than the
organ, the Thoracic is a more vibrant individual than others. He is impelled to an
expressiveness of voice, manner and action that often looks like prete</pre></div> </div>
